      <h1 class="titleC">Garry Kasparov</h1>
      <p class="textC">
        Garry Kasparov, in full Garri Kimovich Kasparov, (born April 13, 1963,
        Baku, Azerbaijan, U.S.S.R. ) is a Soviet-born chess master who became
        the world chess champion in 1985. Kasparov was the youngest world chess
        champion (at 22 years of age).
        <br><br>Kasparov was born to a Jewish father and an armenian mother. He began
        playing chess at age 6, by age 13 was the Soviet youth champion, and won
        his first international tournament at age 16 in 1979. Kasparov became an
        international grandmaster in 1980. From 1973 to 1978 he studied under former
        world champion Mikhail Botvinnik.
        <br><br>Kasparov first challenged the reigning world champion Anatoly Karpov
        in a 1984–85 match, after he survived the Fédération Internationale des Échecs
        (FIDE; the international chess federation) series of elimination matches.
        Kasparov lost four out of the first nine games but then adopted a careful
        defensive stance, taking an extraordinarily long series of drawn games with
        the champion. With Kasparov finally having won three games from the exhausted
        Karpov, FIDE halted the series after 48 games, a decision protested by Kasparov.
        In the two players’ rematch in 1985, Kasparov narrowly defeated Karpov in a
        24-game series and thereby became the youngest official champion in the history
        of the game.n 1996 Kasparov defeated a powerful IBM custom-built chess computer
        known as Deep Blue in a match that attracted worldwide attention. Kasparov
        and the team of Deep Blue programmers agreed to have a rematch in 1997.
        <br>Deep Blue’s intelligence was upgraded, and the machine prevailed. Kasparov
        resigned in the last game of the six-game match after 19 moves, granting
        the win to Deep Blue. In 2000 Kasparov lost a 16-game championship match
        to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia.Kasparov retired from competitive chess in
        2005, though not from involvement in chess. In particular, he produced an
        acclaimed series of books, Kasparov on My Great Predecessors (2003–06),
        that covered all the world chess champions from Wilhelm Steinitz through
        Karpov, as well as many other great players.

      <h1 class="titleC">Mikhail Botvinnik</h1>
      <p class="textC">
        Mikhail Botvinnik was a Soviet and Russian Grandmaster, and the sixth
        World Chess Champion (1948-1963).  He held the world champion title for
        close to 15 years (with two brief breaks in 1957 and 1960), and played chess
        at its highest level for over 30 years.  Botvinnik is widely accepted as one
        of the strongest players of all time, and is known as the father of the Soviet
        Chess School.  His students include World Champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry
        Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik (as well as many other Grandmasters).<br><br>
        Botvinnik’s playing style was dictated by iron logic.  He was very strong
        and well-rounded in all aspects of the game, with a focus on methodical and
        long-term strategic play. Botvinnik viewed himself as having a "universal style",
        which he could change according to who he was facing.  He was not afraid of any
        type of position, and would often seek complications and unclear positions.<br><br>
        Botvinnik learned chess at the age of 12, and two years later he defeated World
        Champion Jose Raul Capablanca in a simultaneous exhibition game.  His chess
        continued to improve quickly during his teenage years. In 1927, he placed 5th
        in the Soviet Union Championships and earned his National Master title (at the
        age of 16).  In 1930, he won the Leningrad Championship, his first major title.
        His game was extremely mature by the age of 20, and he won his first Soviet
        Championship in 1931. After becoming Soviet champion, Botvinnik's rise to
        prominence began.  He improved his overall game between 1931 and 1935, becoming
        one of the best players in the world.  In 1935, he shared first place in the s
        econd Moscow international tournament with Salo Flohr, 1/2 a point ahead of
        Lasker and a full point ahead of Capablanca.  In 1936, he shared first place in
        Nottingham with Capablanca, 1/2 a point ahead of current World Champion Max Euwe
        and one point ahead of Alexander Alekhine, Samuel Reshevsky, and Reuben Fine.<br>

      <h1 class="titleC">José Raúl Capablanca</h1>
      <p class="textC">
        José Raúl Capablanca y Graupera (1888-1942) was the third World Champion,
        reigning from 1921 until 1927. Renowned for the simplicity of his play, his
        legendary endgame prowess, accuracy, and the speed of his play, he earned the
        nickname of the "Human Chess Machine". <br><br>
        His skill in rapid chess lent itself to simultaneous exhibitions. On a nationwide
        tour of 27 cities in 1909, he achieved a winning score of 96.9% over 607 games.
        He qualified for the 1911 World Chess Championship against Lasker, but he was unsatisfied
        with the terms of the match and did not compete. In 1913, Capablanca’s chess skills got him
        a job as an informal ambassador with the Cuban Foreign Office, representing Cuba at
        international events. He held exhibitions in London, Paris, and Berlin before his ultimate
        destination of Saint Petersburg in 1914, where he played and narrowly lost to Lasker.
        World War I halted international competition, but Capablanca continued to compete and dominate,
        losing only one game between 1914 and 1924. In 1921, Capablanca and Lasker competed in the 3rd
        World Chess Championship, where Lasker resigned after losing four straight games.
        Capablanca held the title until 1927, when he lost to Alexander Alekhine. He played
        in several tournaments attempting to regain his title, but despite performing well,
        he could never match his former greatness. He retired briefly in 1931 before returning
        later in the 1930s. International competition again was halted during World War II, and
        it was during this hiatus that he passed away in 1942.<br><br>
        Perhaps the greatest natural player ever, “Capa” often defeated world-famous
        opponents with apparent ease. He was a master of positional play, but could also play great
        tactical chess. Handsome and elegant, he is one of the most beloved and admired champions.

      <h1 class="titleC">Bobby Fischer</h1>
      <p class="textC">
        Bobby Fischer, byname of Robert James Fischer 1943-2008, American-born
        chess master who became the youngest grandmaster in history when he received
        the title in 1958. His youthful intemperance and brilliant playing drew the attention
        of the American public to the game of chess, particularly when he won the world
        championship in 1972.<br><br>
        Fischer learned the moves of chess at age six. He attracted international attention in
        1956 with a stunning victory over Donald Byrne at a tournament in New York City. In what
        was dubbed the “Game of the Century,” Fischer sacrificed his queen on the 17th move to Byrne
        to set up a devastating counterattack that led to checkmate. At age 16 he dropped out of high
        school to devote himself fully to the game. In 1958 he won the first of eight American championships.
        He became the only player ever to earn a perfect score at an American championship, winning all 11
        games in the 1964 tournament.<br><br>
        In world championship candidate matches during 1970–71, Fischer won 20 consecutive games before
        losing once and drawing three times to former world champion Tigran Petrosyan of the Soviet Union
        in a final match won by Fischer. In 1972 Fischer became the first native-born American to hold the
        title of world champion when he defeated Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a match held in
        Reykjavík, Iceland. The tournament was highly publicized. The Soviet Union dominated chess; all
        the world champions since the end of World War II had been Soviets. The Fischer-Spassky match thus
        became a metaphorical battle in the Cold War. In defeating Spassky 12 1/2–8 1/2, Fischer won the
        $156,000 victor’s share of the $250,000 purse.<br><br>
        In 1975 Fischer refused to meet his Soviet challenger, Anatoly Karpov.
        The Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE; the international chess federation)
        deprived him of his championship and declared Karpov champion by default. Fischer then
        withdrew from serious play for almost 20 years, returning only to defeat Spassky in a privately
        organized rematch in 1992 held in Sveti Stefan, Montenegro, Yugoslavia.

      <h1 class="titleC">Anatoly Karpov</h1>
      <p class="textC">
        Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov (born May 23, 1951) is a Russian chess grandmaster and former
        World Champion. He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated
        by Garry Kasparov. Karpov played five matches against Kasparov for the title from 1984 to 1990
        without ever defeating him in a match, later becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov
        broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest
        against FIDE's new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world's elite,
        many consider Karpov one of the greatest players in history.<br><br>
        His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes.
        He had a peak Elo rating of 2780, and his 102 total months at world number one
        is the third longest of all time, behind Magnus Carlsen and Garry Kasparov, since the
        inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.
