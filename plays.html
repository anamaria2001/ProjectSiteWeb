No winner was declared,<br> so Anatoly Karpov retained the title. A new world championship match would now begin on September 3, 1985 with the initial score set at 0-0."

    "The game is known as Kasparov's Immortal Game, and Garry Kasparov himself has claimed this was the greatest game of chess he ever played.<br>This game was featured in Burgess, Nunn, and Emms excellent 'Mammoth Book of the World’s Greatest Chess Games'.  <br><br>Their introduction to the game states: You are about to witness one of the most extraordinary king-hunts in the history of chess. <br><br>The opening and early middlegame are relatively quiet:  Kasparov adopts an aggressive stance, but Topalov plays flexibly and obtains a fully acceptable position.  <br>Indeed, Kasparov is fighting not to be worse from move 14 to move 24, but as so often when a great champion’s back is against the wall, he gives his opponent plenty of chances to go horribly wrong.  <br>In a moment of inspiration, an amazing idea pops into Kasparov's mind, and he embarks upon a sacrificial sequence. <br>Topalov bravely decides to play down the main line when he had a perfectly safe alternative, but it turns out that Kasparov had been right: his pieces and pawns work in perfect harmony to hunt down the errant black king."

    "The Game of the Century is a famous chess game that was won by the 13-year-old future world champion Bobby Fischer against Donald Byrne in the Rosenwald Memorial Tournament at the Marshall Chess Club in New York City on October 17, 1956. <br><br>In Chess Review, Hans Kmoch dubbed it 'The Game of the Century' and wrote: 'The following game, a stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies. <br><br>In this game, Fischer (playing Black) demonstrates noteworthy innovation and improvisation. Byrne (playing White), after a standard opening, makes a seemingly minor mistake on move 11, losing a tempo by moving the same piece twice. <br>Fischer pounces with brilliant sacrificial play, culminating in a queen sacrifice on move 17. <br>Byrne captures the queen, but Fischer gets far too much material for it – a rook, two bishops, and a pawn. <br>At the end, Fischer's pieces coordinate to force checkmate, while Byrne's queen sits useless on the other side of the board."
